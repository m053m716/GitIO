title: "Cortical population dynamics after stroke in reaching rats."
date: 2020-11-16
excerpt: "We recorded extracellular field potentials from microwire arrays embedded in the contralateral rostral forelimb area
(RFA) and the ipsilateral caudal forelimb area (CFA) with respect to the preferred forelimb used during pellet
retrievals by rats. A subset of rats received a focal vasoconstrictive ischemia in CFA contralateral to the preferred
reaching forelimb, which led to clear motor deficits on this task. <br/><img src='/images/RC-Cover_490x201.png'>"
