I made it to the final round of the KUMC three-minute thesis competition where I presented work that was ultimately published in Journal of Neural Engineering, describing a low-latency, high-fidelity spike discriminator that I implemented for the Intan Stimulation/Recording controller together with my collaborator, Stefano Buccelli.
