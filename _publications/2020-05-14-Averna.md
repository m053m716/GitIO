excerpt: 'Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) was applied to the rat primary sensory cortex in healthy anesthetized rats using both closed- and open-loop paradigms. Changes in firing rates and regimes were tested over the course of a few hours to determine if an effect differentiating the protocols could be detected during this time.'

Intracortical microstimulation can be used successfully to modulate neuronal activity. Activity-dependent stimulation (ADS), in which action potentials recorded extracellularly from a single neuron are used to trigger stimulation at another cortical location (closed-loop), is an effective treatment for behavioral recovery after brain lesion, but the related neurophysiological changes are still not clear. Here, we investigated the ability of ADS and random stimulation (RS) to alter firing patterns of distant cortical locations. We recorded 591 neuronal units from 23 Long-Evan healthy anesthetized rats. Stimulation was delivered to either forelimb or barrel field somatosensory cortex, using either RS or ADS triggered from spikes recorded in the rostral forelimb area (RFA). Both RS and ADS stimulation protocols rapidly altered spike firing within RFA compared with no stimulation. We observed increase in firing rates and change of spike patterns. ADS was more effective than RS in increasing evoked spikes during the stimulation periods, by producing a reliable, progressive increase in stimulus-related activity over time and an increased coupling of the trigger channel with the network. These results are critical for understanding the efficacy of closed-loop electrical microstimulation protocols in altering activity patterns in interconnected brain networks, thus modulating cortical state and functional connectivity.
