excerpt: 'Rats were trained on a &apos;gross&apos; and &apos;fine&apos; forelimb task, implanted with microwire arrays spanning unilateral sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the moving limb, and then tested over the course of days and weeks to determine the longitudinal stability of both spiking unit signals as well as gamma LFP in this context.'
