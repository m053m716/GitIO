excerpt: 'This paper is about the localization of lipoproteins to a particular side and layer of the bilayer membrane of Borrelia, the causative agent of Lyme disease. It is a descriptive study that catalogues this specific property of each putative lipoprotein identified in the Borrelia lipoproteome.'
