2016-01-06	BCI	beginner	Current challenges facing the translation of brain computer interfaces from preclinical trials to use in human patients	Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience	This is a review of the challenges facing the translation of brain computer interfaces from preclinical trials to widespread use in the clinic. There is an emphasis on activity-dependent stimulation and similar paradigms.	Murphy, M. D., Guggenmos, D. J., Bundy, D. T., Nudo, R. J. (2016). Current challenges facing the translation of brain computer interfaces from preclinical trials to use in human patients. Frontiers in cellular neuroscience, 9, 497.	https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2015.00497/pdf	https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2015.00497/pdf	FrontiersReview	Review,BCI,Rehabilitation,Brain Computer Interfaces	Current research in brain computer interface (BCI) technology is advancing beyond preclinical studies, with trials beginning in human patients. To date, these trials have been carried out with several different types of recording interfaces. The success of these devices has varied widely, but different factors such as the level of invasiveness, timescale of recorded information, and ability to maintain stable functionality of the device over a long period of time all must be considered in addition to accuracy in decoding intent when assessing the most practical type of device moving forward. Here, we discuss various approaches to BCIs, distinguishing between devices focusing on control of operations extrinsic to the subject (e.g., prosthetic limbs, computer cursors) and those focusing on control of operations intrinsic to the brain (e.g. using stimulation or external feedback), including closed-loop or adaptive devices. In this discussion, we consider the current challenges facing the translation of various types of BCI technology to eventual human application.
2017-01-09	Borrelia Lipoproteome	advanced	Comprehensive spatial analysis of the Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteome reveals a compartmentalization bias toward the bacterial surface	Journal of Bacteriology	This paper is about the localization of lipoproteins to a particular side and layer of the bilayer membrane of Borrelia, the causative agent of Lyme disease. It is a descriptive study that catalogues this specific property of each putative lipoprotein identified in the Borrelia lipoproteome.	Dowdell, A. S., Murphy, M. D., Azodi, C., Swanson, S. K., Florens, L., Chen, S., Zuckert, W. R. (2017). Comprehensive spatial analysis of the Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteome reveals a compartmentalization bias toward the bacterial surface. Journal of bacteriology, 199(6).	https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/199/6/e00658-16.full.pdf	https://jb.asm.org/content/jb/199/6/e00658-16.full.pdf	Borrelia	Borrelia,Burgdorferi,Lipoprotein,Lyme Disease	The Lyme disease spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi is unique among bacteria in its large number of lipoproteins that are encoded by a small, exceptionally fragmented, and predominantly linear genome. Peripherally anchored in either the inner or outer membrane and facing either the periplasm or the external environment, these lipoproteins assume varied roles. A prominent subset of lipoproteins functioning as the apparent linchpins of the enzootic tick-vertebrate infection cycle have been explored as vaccine targets. Yet, most of the B. burgdorferi lipoproteome has remained uncharacterized. Here, we comprehensively and conclusively localize the B. burgdorferi lipoproteome by applying established protein localization assays to a newly generated epitope-tagged lipoprotein expression library and by validating the obtained individual protein localization results using a sensitive global mass spectrometry approach. The derived consensus localization data indicate that 86 of the 125 analyzed lipoproteins encoded by B. burgdorferi are secreted to the bacterial surface. Thirty-one of the remaining 39 periplasmic lipoproteins are retained in the inner membrane, with only 8 lipoproteins being anchored in the periplasmic leaflet of the outer membrane. The localization of 10 lipoproteins was further defined or revised, and 52 surface and 23 periplasmic lipoproteins were newly localized. Cross-referencing prior studies revealed that the borrelial surface lipoproteome contributing to the host-pathogen interface is encoded predominantly by plasmids. Conversely, periplasmic lipoproteins are encoded mainly by chromosomal loci. These studies close a gap in our understanding of the functional lipoproteome of an important human pathogen and set the stage for more in-depth studies of thus-far-neglected spirochetal lipoproteins.

LFADS is a recently-developed deep learning method that uses stimulus-aligned neural spiking data to determine the initial neural state of each trial, as well as infer a set of time-dependent perturbations to the learned neural dynamics within trials. We show that time-dependent perturbations inferred by an LFADS model trained on spikes from trials on a single session can distinguish between different stimulation conditions. Furthermore, we use these data to exemplify how LFADS inferences track the evolution of stimulus-related spiking responses during chronic microstimulation experiments.

Activity-dependent stimulation (ADS) is designed to strengthen the connections between neuronal circuits and therefore may be a promising tool for promoting neurophysiological reorganization following a brain injury. To successfully perform this technique, two criteria must be met: (1) spikes in the extracellular electrical field potential must be detected accurately at one site of interest, and (2) stimulation pulses generated at fixed (<1-ms jitter), low-latency (<10-ms) intervals relative to each detected spike must be delivered reliably to a second site of interest. Here, we aimed to improve noise rejection in a low-cost commercial system to reliably perform ADS in awake, behaving rats, while maintaining latency requirements. Approach. We implemented a spike detection state machine on a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Because the accuracy of spike detection can be heavily reduced in awake and behaving animals due to biological artifacts such as movement and chewing, the state machine tracks candidate spike waveforms, checking them against multiple programmable thresholds and rejecting any spikes that fail to meet a programmed threshold criterion. Main Results. A series of offline analyses showed that our implementation was able to appropriately trigger stimulation during epochs of biological artifacts with an overall accuracy between 72% and 97%, fixed computational latency of .167 ms, and an algorithmic latency of .300 ms to .800 ms. Significance. Our improvements have been made open-source and are freely available to all scientists working on closed-loop neuroprosthetic devices. Importantly, the improvements are easily incorporated into existing workflows that utilize the Intan Stimulation and Recording Controller.

Bundy, D. T., Guggenmos, D. J., Murphy, M. D., Nudo, R. J. (2019). Chronic stability of single-channel neurophysiological correlates of gross and fine reaching movements in the rat. PloS one, 14(10), e0219034.	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219034&type=printable	https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/file?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0219034&type=printable	Bundy	Rat,Reaching,Motor,Neurophysiology,Spike,LFP,Cortex	While substantial task-related neural activity has been observed during motor tasks in rodent primary motor cortex and premotor cortex, the long-term stability of these responses in healthy rats is uncertain, limiting the interpretability of longitudinal changes in the specific patterns of neural activity associated with learning or motor recovery following injury. This study examined the stability of task-related neural activity associated with execution of two distinct reaching tasks in healthy rodents. A novel automated rodent behavioral apparatus was constructed and rats were trained to perform a reaching task combining a (gross) lever press and a (fine) pellet retrieval. In each animal, two chronic microelectrode arrays were implanted in motor cortex spanning the caudal forelimb area (rodent primary motor cortex) and the rostral forelimb area (rodent premotor cortex). We recorded multiunit spiking and local field potential activity from 10 days to 7-10 weeks post-implantation to characterize the patterns of neural activity observed during each task component and analyzed the consistency of channel-specific task-related neural activity. Task-related changes in neural activity were observed on the majority of channels. While the task-related changes in multi-unit spiking and local field potential spectral power were consistent over several weeks, spectral power changes were more stable, despite the trade-off of decreased spatial and temporal resolution. These results show that neural activity in rodent primary and premotor cortex is associated with specific phases of reaching movements with stable patterns of task-related activity across time, establishing the relevance of the rodent for future studies designed to examine changes in task-related neural activity during recovery from focal cortical lesions.
2020-05-14	Anesthetized Rat	advanced	Differential effects of open-and closed-loop intracortical microstimulation on firing patterns of neurons in distant cortical areas	Cerebral cortex	Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) was applied to the rat primary sensory cortex in healthy anesthetized rats using both closed- and open-loop paradigms. Changes in firing rates and regimes were tested over the course of a few hours to determine if an effect differentiating the protocols could be detected during this time.	Averna, A., Pasquale, V., Murphy, M. D., Rogantin, M. P., Van Acker, G. M., Nudo, R. J., Guggenmos, D. J. (2020). Differential effects of open-and closed-loop intracortical microstimulation on firing patterns of neurons in distant cortical areas. Cerebral Cortex, 30(5), 2879-2896.	https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/30/5/2879/5673779	https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article/30/5/2879/5673779	Averna	ICMS,ADS,Anesthetized,Rat,Cortex	Intracortical microstimulation can be used successfully to modulate neuronal activity. Activity-dependent stimulation (ADS), in which action potentials recorded extracellularly from a single neuron are used to trigger stimulation at another cortical location (closed-loop), is an effective treatment for behavioral recovery after brain lesion, but the related neurophysiological changes are still not clear. Here, we investigated the ability of ADS and random stimulation (RS) to alter firing patterns of distant cortical locations. We recorded 591 neuronal units from 23 Long-Evan healthy anesthetized rats. Stimulation was delivered to either forelimb or barrel field somatosensory cortex, using either RS or ADS triggered from spikes recorded in the rostral forelimb area (RFA). Both RS and ADS stimulation protocols rapidly altered spike firing within RFA compared with no stimulation. We observed increase in firing rates and change of spike patterns. ADS was more effective than RS in increasing evoked spikes during the stimulation periods, by producing a reliable, progressive increase in stimulus-related activity over time and an increased coupling of the trigger channel with the network. These results are critical for understanding the efficacy of closed-loop electrical microstimulation protocols in altering activity patterns in interconnected brain networks, thus modulating cortical state and functional connectivity.
2020-11-01	TDCS	advanced	Effects of tDCS on spontaneous spike activity in a healthy ambulatory rat model	Brain Stimulation	We tested whether transcranial direct-current stimulation (tDCS) had any effect on the spike rate or LFP content in ambulatory rats using a within-subject design to test anodal, cathodal, and sham stimulation cases.	Milighetti, S., Sterzi, S., Fregni, F., Hanlon, C. A., Hayley, P., Murphy, M. D., Nudo R. J., Guggenmos, D. J. (2020). Effects of tDCS on spontaneous spike activity in a healthy ambulatory rat model. Brain Stimulation, 13(6), 1566-1576.	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X20302345/pdfft?isDTMRedir=true&download=true	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1935861X20302345/pdfft?isDTMRedir=true&download=true	Millighetti	tDCS,Rat,Ambulatory,Cortex,FEM,Spike,LFP	The neurophysiological effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) are typically described with respect to changes in cortical excitability, defined by using transcranial magnetic stimulation pulses to determine changes in motor evoked potentials. However, how individual cortical neurons change firing patterns under the influence of tDCS is largely unknown. While the relatively weak currents produced in the brain by tDCS may not be adequate to directly depolarize neuronal membranes, ongoing neuronal activity, combined with subthreshold changes in membrane polarization might be sufficient to alter the threshold for neural firing. The purpose of this study was to determine the effects of tDCS on neurophysiological activity in motor cortex of freely moving, healthy rats. In nine healthy, ambulatory rats, each studied under six different stimulation conditions varying in current intensity (maximum current density = 39.8 amperes per square-meter at 0.4 mA) and polarity (anodal or cathodal), neural activity was analyzed in response to 20 min of tDCS applied through bone screws insulated from the overlying scalp. After analysis of 480 multi-unit channels that satisfied a rigid set of neurophysiological criteria, we found no systematic effect of tDCS stimulation condition on firing rate or firing pattern. Restricting the analysis to the most responsive units, subtle, but statistically significant changes occurred only in the highest intensity anodal condition. These results confirm that at current densities typically used in human or animal tDCS studies, observed effects of tDCS are likely to occur via mechanisms other than direct neuronal depolarization.
