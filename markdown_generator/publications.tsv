2016-01-06	Current challenges facing the translation of brain computer interfaces from preclinical trials to use in human patients	Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience	This is a review of the challenges facing the translation of brain computer interfaces from preclinical trials to widespread use in the clinic. There is an emphasis on activity-dependent stimulation and similar paradigms.	Murphy, M. D., Guggenmos, D. J., Bundy, D. T., & Nudo, R. J. (2016).

2017-01-09	Comprehensive spatial analysis of the Borrelia burgdorferi lipoproteome reveals a compartmentalization bias toward the bacterial surface	Journal of Bacteriology	This paper is about the localization of lipoproteins to a particular side and layer of the bilayer membrane of Borrelia, the causative agent of Lyme disease. It is a descriptive study that catalogues this specific property of each putative lipoprotein identified in the Borrelia lipoproteome.	Dowdell, A. S., Murphy, M. D., Azodi, C., Swanson, S.

2018-05-27	Assessing Perturbations to Neural Spiking Response Dynamics Caused By Electrical Microstimulation	International Symposium on Circuits and Systems	This paper is about a proof-of-concept nonlinear dynamical systems approach applied to peri-stimulus epochs to see if it could detect longitudinal differences in how open- and closed-loop influence the system response to electrical microstimulation of sensory cortex in ambulatory rats.

2019-10-29	Improving an open-source commercial system to reliably perform activity-dependent stimulation	Journal of Neural Engineering	We modified the Intan Stimulation/Recording controller to deliver closed-loop stimulation using a finite state machine to improve artifact rejection, such as may occur due to electrical microstimulation or other physiological events such as chewing and whisking.

2019-10-30	Chronic stability of single-channel neurophysiological correlates of gross and fine reaching movements in the rat	PLoS ONE	Rats were trained on a 'gross' and 'fine' forelimb task, implanted with microwire arrays spanning unilateral sensorimotor cortex contralateral to the moving limb, and then tested over the course of days and weeks to determine the longitudinal stability of both spiking unit signals as well as gamma LFP in this context.

2020-05-14	Differential effects of open-and closed-loop intracortical microstimulation on firing patterns of neurons in distant cortical areas	Cerebral cortex	Intracortical microstimulation (ICMS) was applied to the rat primary sensory cortex in healthy anesthetized rats using both closed- and open-loop paradigms. Changes in firing rates and regimes were tested over the course of a few hours to determine if an effect differentiating the protocols could be detected during this time.
