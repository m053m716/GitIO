### First Post: On Academic Service ###
Check out **[my thoughts on modern peer review](https://m053m716.github.io/posts/2020-11-16-Service)**. I see *peer review* as the main way in which I can currently provide a service to my academic peers. However, I have a real bone to pick with the details of how peer review is conducted in practice.

#### Argument ####
The act of publishing articles in journals other than **[Nature](https://www.nature.com)** or comparable is **unethical**. Publication in other journals *(with few exceptions)* dilutes knowledge and fundamentally threatens the *true* institution of **peer review**. Unfortunately, the current **traditional peer review** model perpetuated by predatory publishers such as **[IOP](https://ioppublishing.org/)**, **[Elsevier](https://www.elsevier.com/)**, **[Taylor and Francis](https://www.tandfonline.com/)**, and **[Springer](https://www.springer.com/gp)** only serves to encourage the aforementioned knowledge dilution. Worse, these syndicates waste the time of well-meaning scientists by advocating erroneous arguments for how the **traditional peer review** model serves science while in reality it is simply a source of *free, expert labor*. In this post, I argue that **modern peer review** supplants this traditional model, because technologically the services of the journals is no longer required. I concede that a few journals remain viable and provide useful services, but ultimately we will need a better way to recognize **academic service** with respect to knowledge curation and dissemination because the traditional "currency" of the academic system--publications--is no longer a tenable solution for the next generation of up-and-coming scientists.
