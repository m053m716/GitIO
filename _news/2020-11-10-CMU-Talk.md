### Virtual presentation: Carnegie Mellon University ###
I presented a modified version of my thesis to the Weber lab and affiliate faculty, going into a little more technical detail about the results from Aim 1 of my dissertation. 

#### Aftermath ####
It was so nice to meet everyone there and hear about their work. I was so impressed with all the interesting projects that are ongoing and look forward to hearing more in the future.
