### Thoughts on TCOE ###
I am an avid fan of Dungeons & Dragons (5e), which means I run games for some of my friends (more frequently the case in the past). Recently, Wizards of the Coast released a new supplement (Tasha's Cauldron of Everything; TCOE), which introduces new optional class features. I had an immediate dislike to one of the new Fighter class features, so I decided **[to do some simulations](https://m053m716.github.io/posts/2020-11-22-EvaluatingNewFightingStyle)**. 

#### Argument ####
I initially thought that **Superior Technique** was over-powered as a Fighting Style and added too much damage in addition to the utility it affords due to access to Battle Maneuvers previously reserved for access through feats (which are costly to spend on this) or by sub-classing Fighter to the Battle Master class (which was usually how Maneuvers would be obtained). However, simulations show that **Great Weapon Fighter** fighting style still has an increased damage expectation compared to baseline damage expected to be added from **Superior Technique**. Further analysis is required to include the utility effects that are peculiar to each **Maneuver** that could be selected when choosing this Fighting Style.
